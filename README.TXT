Answers to Lab 9, Part I:

#1 Comments list works correctly, size increases. The array list has a size of 10.

#2 It correctly prints in both cases.

#3 Works correctly.

#4 Comment is rejected and not added to the list.

#5 Everything works correctly. 0 is accepted though.

#6 0 is accepted and 6 is rejected.

#7 Downvoting a comment with 0 votes makes it negative. Second problem is that when an index from out of bounds of the array is specified
   it will still act as if the comment was downvoted.

#8 Works correctly. 

#9 Error: java.util.NoSuchElementException

#10
